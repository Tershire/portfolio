Welcome to the world of Tershire!

My name is Wonhee Lee, currently a master's student at ISAE-SUPAERO.

Space & Light are the keywords of my life.

My interests are mono visual(-inertial) SLAM, developmental robotics, SNN, FPSP, GBP, DRL, neural rendering, genetic-evolutionary algorithms, and cellular automata.
